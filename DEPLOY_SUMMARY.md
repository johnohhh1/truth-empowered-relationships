## üîß Configuration (Optional)

### For Better Quality
Add OpenAI API key to Vercel for premium features:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/johnohhh1/truth-empowered-relationships
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
3. Add: `OPENAI_API_KEY` = `sk-your-key-here`
4. Click **Save**
5. Redeploy (Vercel will ask)

**With API key you get**:
- Better speech recognition (Whisper)
- High-quality TTS voices (6 options)
- More accurate transcription

**Without API key**:
- Browser speech recognition (still good!)
- Browser TTS (works but robotic)
- Everything still functional

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Microphone not working"
- **Cause**: Need HTTPS (security requirement)
- **Fix**: Works on localhost and Vercel (both HTTPS)
- **Note**: Browser will ask for permission first time

### "Speech sounds robotic"
- **Cause**: Using browser TTS instead of OpenAI
- **Fix**: Add OpenAI API key to Vercel settings
- **Note**: Browser TTS still works, just lower quality

### "Can't hear anything"
- **Cause**: System/browser volume
- **Fix**: Check volume settings, unmute browser tab
- **Note**: Look for pulsing speaker icon (means it's working)

### "Transcription inaccurate"
- **Cause**: Background noise or unclear speech
- **Fix**: Speak clearly, reduce background noise
- **Upgrade**: Add OpenAI key for Whisper (more accurate)
